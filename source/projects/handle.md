Handle features:

* Simple Markdown content editing and Blade templating
* Developer's already use the command line for other build tools, why not build your entire website as well?
* It can be integrated with other scripts to fit into your build process wherever you like (e.g. build locally and deploy your site to the server or deploy your site to the server and trigger a build then)
* Handle generates a complete HTML website. Think of it as the cache level of your site. You don't even need to run PHP on your server!
* It doesn't need a GUI and it doesn't need to generate pages on the fly, making it fast

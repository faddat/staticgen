Yellow is for people who make websites.

1. [Download Yellow and unzip it](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/archive/master.zip).
2. Enter the following command: php yellow.php build /var/www/website
3. Upload generated website to your web hosting.

This will build a complete, static website in folder /var/www/website. A static website doesn't need a Yellow installation anymore. Most websites, blogs and wikis can be made this way. Upload the folder to your web hosting and build a new version when needed. [Learn more](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/wiki).
